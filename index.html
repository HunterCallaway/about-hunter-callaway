			<p>My name is Hunter Callaway. I'm originally from Amarillo, Texas. I'm new around here.</p>
			<p>I was a French major in college, so I'm decent with human languages. When it comes to programming languages, however, I'm still a novice.</p>
			<p>My interests include the visual arts, cinema, literature, watching professional tennis, and, of course, programming.</p>
