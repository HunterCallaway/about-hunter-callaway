		<h1>Hello, everyone!</h1>
		<img src="IMG_0468.jpg" alt="Picture of me"/>
		<p>My name is Hunter Callaway. I'm originally from Amarillo, Texas, which means I'm new around here.</p>
		<p>I was a French major in college, so I'm decent with human languages.
			When it comes to programming languages, however, I'm still a novice.
		</p>
		<p>My interests include the visual arts, cinema, literature, watching professional tennis, and, of course, programming.</p>
